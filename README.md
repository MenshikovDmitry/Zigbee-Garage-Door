# Zigbee Garage Door Opener
This is a DIY Zigbee garage door opener, designed for use with Home Assistant and [Zigbee2MQTT](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/).  
  
It supports any dry-contact-operated garage door or other device that requires a dry contact. The device includes two switches for relays and two door sensors (reed switches) for feedback. Each switch functions as a pulse switch when activated: it triggers the relay for 300 ms and then turns off.

## Power Supply
The single PCB design supports three options. Choose the one that fits your needs:
1. **HLK-PM01** for 220v input
2. **Mini560 Pro 5v** for 6-32v input
3. Directly solder the power supply to the **+** and **GND** pads for 3.3v-12v input. In this case, voltage step-down will be done by the built-in linear voltage regulator **AMS1117-3.3V**.

## Firmware
The firmware is based on the [PTVO](https://ptvo.info/) project. Please consider supporting the author.
There are two almost equal firmware versions:
1) stock PTVO - does not require external converter for Zigbee2MQTT. The downside is that reed switches are exposed as regular switches.
2) custom - requires a custom converter for Zigbee2MQTT. The reed switches are exposed as door sensors.

### Flashing
You will need a CC Debugger (find one on Aliexpress) and [SmartRF Flash Programmer](https://www.ti.com/tool/FLASH-PROGRAMMER) **_V1_** to flash the firmware. Refer to the user manual [here](https://ptvo.info/how-to-select-and-flash-cc2530-144/).
## Pairing
Option 1: Flash the device, and it will boot in pairing mode  
Option 2: Press and hold the tact button on the pcb for 10 seconds, until the LED starts blinking every 1 second.

When the device is paired, the LED will blink every 5 seconds.
## Operating
The best way to operate this device with Home Assistant is creating a garage door entity with [template cover](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/cover.template/) in your `configuration.yaml`.
```yaml
cover:
  - platform: template
    covers:
      garage_door:
        device_class: garage
        unique_id: cover.garage_door
        friendly_name: "Garage Door"
        position_template: "{{ {'on': 100, 'off':0}.get(states('binary_sensor.garage_door_contact'))  }}"
        open_cover:
          - action: switch.turn_on
            target:
              entity_id: switch.garage_l2
        close_cover:
          - action: switch.turn_on
            target:
              entity_id: switch.garage_l2
        stop_cover:
          action: switch.turn_on
          target:
            entity_id: switch.garage_l2
        icon_template: >-
          {% if states('binary_sensor.garage_door_contact')|float > 0 %}
            mdi:garage-open
          {% else %}
            mdi:garage
          {% endif %}  
```

## Wiring
**Attention:** This project involves high voltage wiring. It must be done by a professional.

## Customization

The PCB supports customization with additional pins. Nothing stops you from adding more reed switches straight out of the box. it will require a bit of soldering though. The firmware will need to be adjusted accordingly.
