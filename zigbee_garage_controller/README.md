!! **ATTENTION** !!  
This is a secon iteration of the PCB. It has not been tested yet. Firmware is coming after the testing, but feel free to configure your own with PTVO.     
There is also revision 1.0 of the PCB, which is tested and working, but does not have reed switch support and does not support customization with additional pins.  
Stay tuned for updates.
